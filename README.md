Predicting and Analyzing U.S. Flight Delays: Identifying Key Factors and Improving Forecast Accuracy

Proposal -

Flight delays are one of the most serious challenges in the US aviation industry, causing huge inconvenience and coupled with losses to airline companies. This work examines the key patterns, causes, and trends in US flights taken from January 2017 to July 2022 that have an impact on flight punctuality. This will help airlines understand the root cause of the delay problem and thus enable them to optimize their flight schedule further for better passenger satisfaction.

The dataset from Kaggle contains flight details, including the departure and arrival time, airline operating, airport from which and where it landed, duration of delay, and finally consolidated weather data. This dataset has over millions of values, thereby providing an adequate overview of flight operations and further delays in the US over a considerable period.

SMART questions – 

1.	"Can we predict the total delay time for flights in the U.S. with the highest accuracy using historical data (2017–2022), based on factors such as airline efficiency, airport traffic, weather conditions, and National Aviation System, to provide valuable insights for airlines, airports, and regulatory bodies to optimize scheduling and reduce delays for future flight operations?"
2.	"How can we leverage real-time data and machine learning to accurately predict flight delays in the U.S. based on chronicled data, considering factors like weather conditions, air traffic, intervene of National Aviation System, and airline operations, to enhance scheduling and minimize disruptions across the aviation network?"
